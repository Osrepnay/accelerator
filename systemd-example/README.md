This directory contains an example udev rule and systemd service to automatically start accelerator when the device, the Logitech M570, is added. For now the curve is hardcoded into the service; config options might get moved to a config file later.

To adapt this to your mouse, read up on udev rules and update the .rules and .service file accordingly.
