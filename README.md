# accelerator

A program to add custom (linear, for now) mouse acceleration to a mouse using [evdev-rs](https://github.com/ndesh26/evdev-rs).

For options, run `path/to/accelerator -h`.

Acceleration formula should be identical or at least very similar to [Raw Accel](https://github.com/a1xd/rawaccel)'s linear formula with gain turned off.
